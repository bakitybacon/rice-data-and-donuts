The interactive exercises for this tutorial for R are available at http://www.shadyweb.site/shiny/tsa/InteractiveExercisesR.Rmd . Please note this page takes quite a while to load! If it's possible, it's better to download the .Rmd file and run it on your local computer.

The interactive Python exercises are in the Jupyter Notebook file. You'll have to install jupyter on your local machine and run it there.
